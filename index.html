            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control software allows teams of programmers (or software developers) to manage changes in code made over time. It keeps track of every modification made to the code and allows users to keep track of it in a database; if errors are made, you can go back to previous working editions without disrupting work flow. VCS interests me because it makes changing code less daunting and is useful for our class because many of our assignments include altering code.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Github</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Github is a version control software that is easy to use and learn for beginners. It allows use of local and remote respositories, connecting the two between SSH keys. Git is interesting to me because we need to use it for all of our assignments and it makes learning version control software easy. It is relevant to our course in the same way.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The most essential git commands for our uses are git push and git pull. Pulling is essentially uploading files to whatever repository you are in while pushing is downloading them to another. These commands are interesting to me because they are integral to git usage and they are relevant to our course because they are what we use to move files between repositories.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Creating Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Creating repositories is very easy. All it takes is the git init command. For example, in cloud 9, if you type git init into the terminal it creates an empty repository. Then, you create one on github; after that, all you need to do is link the two with the SSH key and you can move files between the two. Creating repositories is interesting to me because they are part of git usage and they are relevant to our course because they are what we use to move our files.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Keeping track of changes in git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In order to keep track of changes that you make to files in git, all you need to do is use the git status command. If you have the files added to your tracked list, it will show you changes that are yet to be commited; aka, what has changed. This is interesting to me because this is useful for staying on top of your software changes and relevant to the course in that it is useful for staying up to date on our work.</p>
